# MSDS 434 Project Week 6 GCP Set Up AutoML Trained Model - Spencer Puterbaugh

- This document has been assembled in order to show the actions taken to work on the final project for this course
- AutoML WAS NOT UTILIZED in the final project, as it was determined that a custom model developed in week 5 with BigQuery ML was more appropriate given the need for a neural network with specific parameters.
- However, for the course work an AutoML/Vertex AI model was developed using different data to fulfill the assignment requirements for week 6
    - The video that was made for that week's assignment is included here to show that AutoML was evaluated and could have been utilized if needed.
